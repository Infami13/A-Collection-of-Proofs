## Exercise 9

Suppose $z = a + bi$, $w = c + di$. Define $z < w$ if $a < c$, and also if $a = c$ but $b < d$. Prove that this turns the set of all complex numbers into an ordered set. Does this ordered set have the least-upper-bound property?

### Solution

To show all members of the complex numbers are comparable under this order, suppose to the contrary that none of the statements $z < w$, $z = w$, $z > w$ is true. Given $z \ne w$, we have $a \ne c$. Further, $z \nless w$ implies $a > c
