## Exercise

Prove that no order can be defined in the complex field that turns it into an ordered field.

### Solution

We know $i$ cannot be $0$, so either $i > 0$ or $i < 0$. If $i > 0$ then $-1 = i^2 > 0$. This then implies $0 > 1$, a contradiction. If $i < 0$, then $-i > 0$ and $-1 = (-i)^2 > 0$, which we have seen to be a contradiction. That is to say, we have at least two elements that cannot satisfy the properties of an ordered field without causing a contradiction. Hence there is no order that can turns the complex field into an ordered field.
