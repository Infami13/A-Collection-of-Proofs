## Exercise

Prove that no order can be defined in the complex field that turns it into an ordered field.

### Solution

By trichotemy, exactly one of $i > 0$, $i < 0$, or $i = 0$ holds. If $i > 0$ then $-1 = i^2 > 0$. By adding $1$ to both sides, this implies $0 > 1$, a contradiction. If $i < 0$ then $-i > 0$ and $-1 = (-i)^2 > 0$, which we have seen to be a contradiction. If $i = 0$ then $\left( i^2 \right) ^2 = (-1)^2 = 1 = 0 = 0^2 = \left( 0^2 \right) ^2,$ which contradicts $1 \ne 0$. That is to say, we have at least two elements that cannot satisfy the properties of an ordered field without causing a contradiction. Hence there is no order that can turns the complex field into an ordered field.
