## Exercise 1

### Problem
Let $F$ be an ordered field and $x, y, z \in F$. Prove if $x < 0$ and $y < z$, then $xy > xz$.

### Solution

Given $x < 0$, then $-x > 0$ by Proposition 1.1.8 (*i*). Further, if $y < z$, then $y + (-y) < z + (-y)$ by Definition 1.1.7. Using the axioms of an ordered field, we may algebraically assert $z - y > 0$. Using Definition 1.1.7, we have $-x(z - y) > -x0$ or $-xz + xy > 0$. Finally, by adding $xz$ to both sides, we find $xy > xz$ as desired.

## Exercise 2

### Problem

Let $S$ be an ordered set. Let $A \subset S$ be a nonempty finite subset. Then $A$ is bounded. Furthermore, $\inf A$ exists and is in $A$ and $\sup A$ exists and is in $A$. Hint: Use induction.

### Solution

Supp
