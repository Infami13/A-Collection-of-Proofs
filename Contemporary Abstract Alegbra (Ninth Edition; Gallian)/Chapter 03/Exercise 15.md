## Exercise
(1969 Putnam Competition) Prove that no group is the union of two proper subgroups. Does the statement remain true if "two" is replaced by "three"?

### Solution
Suppose to the contrary we may form group $G$ with the union of two proper subgroups $H$ and $K$. Symbolically, this means $G = H \cup K$. Without loss of generality, suppose $H \subseteq K$. That is, $H \cup K = K < G$. More explicitly, we see that $H \cup K \ne G$. So it must be the case that there is an element $k \in K \setminus H$

Given $H$ and $K$ are non-equal, we may assume (without loss of generality) there exists an element $h$ that is in $H$ but not $K$.
