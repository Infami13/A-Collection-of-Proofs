## Exercise
Let $n$ be a positive even integer and let $H$ be a subgroup of $Z_n$ of odd order. Prove that every member of $H$ is an even integer.

### Solution
By the previous exercise, we know that either every member of $H$ is even or exactly half of the members of $H$ are even. Given $|H|$ is odd, we cannot split $H$ evenly. It must then be the case that every member of $H$ is even.
