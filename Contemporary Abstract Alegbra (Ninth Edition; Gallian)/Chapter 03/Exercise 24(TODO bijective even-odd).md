## Exercise
Suppose $n$ is an even positive integer and $H$ is a subgroup of $Z_n$. Prove that either every member of $H$ is even or exactly half of the members of $H$ are even.

### Solution
If $H$ contains no odd member, we are done. Otherwise, if $H$ contains at least one odd integer (say $a$), let $A$ be the set of all odd integers in $H$ and $B$ be the set of all even integers in $H$. Given every integer is exclusively even or odd, then $A$ and $B$ form a partition of $H$; all that remains is to show $|A| = |B|$. To do this, consider the function $f: A -> B$
