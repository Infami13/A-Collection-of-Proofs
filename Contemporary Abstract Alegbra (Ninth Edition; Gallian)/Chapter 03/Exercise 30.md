## Exercise

Suppose that $H$ is a proper subgroup of $Z$ under addition and $H$ contains 18, 30, and 40. Determine $H$.

### Solution

Given $H$ is a proper subgroup, we know $H \ne <1> = Z$. However, with $30, 40 \in H$, we must have $30 + (-40) = 10 \in H$. Given $10, 18 \in H$ then $8 \in H$, which then implies $2 \in H$.
