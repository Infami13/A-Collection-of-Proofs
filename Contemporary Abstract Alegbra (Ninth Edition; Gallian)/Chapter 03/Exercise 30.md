## Exercise

Suppose that $H$ is a proper subgroup of $Z$ under addition and $H$ contains 18, 30, and 40. Determine $H$.

### Solution

Note that 1 and 2 are the only common divisors of 18, 30, and 40. That is, candidates for $H$ include $\langle 1 \rangle$ and $\langle 2 \rangle$. Given $H$ is a proper subgroup, then $H \ne \langle 1 \rangle = Z$. This leaves $H = \langle 2 \rangle$.
