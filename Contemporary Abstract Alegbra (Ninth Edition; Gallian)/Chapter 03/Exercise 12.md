## Exercise

Complete the statement "A group element $x$ is its own inverse if and only if $|x| = \textunderscore$."

### Solution

"A group element $x$ is its own inverse if and only if $|x| = 2$."

If $x$ is its own inverse, then $x = x^{-1}$. In which case $x^2 = e$ and $|x|=2$. The order direction follows analogously in reverse order.

Additionally, we assume $x$ is meant to be a non-identity element.
