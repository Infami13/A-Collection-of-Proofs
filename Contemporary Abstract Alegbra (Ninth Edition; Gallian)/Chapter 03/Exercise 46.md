## Exercise

Suppose $a$ belongs to a group and $|a|=5$. Prove that $C(a) = C(a^3)$. Find an element $a$ from some group such that $|a| = 6$ and $C(a) \ne C(a^3)$.

### Solution

Let $c \in C(a)$ so that $ac = ca$. It immediately follows 
$$a^3c = aa(ac) = aa(ca) = a(ac)a = a(ca)a = (ac)aa = (ca)aa = ca^3$$.
