## Exercise
Let $G$ be the group of symmetries of a circle and $R$ be a rotation of the circle of $\sqrt 2$ degrees. What is $|R|$?

### Solution
$R$ has infinite order. If we were to suppose to the contrary that $|R| = n$ for some positive integer $n$, then $nR$ would be equal to some multiple of $360$. That is $n\sqrt 2 = 360m$, where $n,m \in Z$. We would then have $\sqrt 2 = 360m / n$ with $m,n\in Z$, implying $\sqrt 2$ is rational (an absurdity). As such, it must be that $R$ does not have finite order.
