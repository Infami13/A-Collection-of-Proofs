## Exercise
Let $G$ be the group of symmetries of a circle and $R$ be a rotation of the circle of $\sqrt 2$ degrees. What is $|R|$?

### Solution
$R$ has infinite order. If we were to suppose to the contrary that $|R| = n$ for some positive integer $n$, then $nR$ would be equal to some multiple of $360$. That is $n\sqrt 2 = 360m$, where $n,m \in Z$. Of course, $360m \in Q$. However, $n\sqrt 2 \in Q$ would imply $\sqrt 2 \in Q$, which is absurd. It must be that there is no positive integer $n$ such that $n\sqrt 2 = 360m$. As such, $R$ does not have finite order.
