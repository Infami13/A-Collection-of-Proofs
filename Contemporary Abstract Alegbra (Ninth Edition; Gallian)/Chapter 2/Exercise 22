## Exercise
Let $G$ be a group with the property that for any $x, y, z$ in the group, $xy = zx$ implies $y = z$. Prove that $G$ is Abelian.

### Solution
Let $a,b \in G$. By closure, we have $ab, ba \in G$. By associativity, $a(ba)=(ab)a$ which then implies $ba = ab$. Given $a$ and $b$ were choosen arbitrarily, then $ba = ab$ for all $a, b \in G$. That is, $G$ is Abelian.
