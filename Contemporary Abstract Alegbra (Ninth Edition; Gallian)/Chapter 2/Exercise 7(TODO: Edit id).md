## Exercise
Give two reasons why the set of odd integers under addition is not a group.

### Solution
Let $S$ denote the set of odd integers. Notice that $S$ does not contain an identity element and is not closed under its binary operation, addition.

To show $S$ does not contain an identity element, suppose to the contrary that there exists a $e'\in S$ such that $s + e' = s$ for each $s\in S$. Particularly, $1 + e' = 1$ for $1\in S$. Using familiar integral arithmetic , we find $e' = 0$. However, we reach a contradiction as $0 \notin S$.

To show $S$ is not closed under addition, note that $1 \in S$. However, $1 + 1 = 2 \notin S$.
