This is common discussion topic in ring algebra with the integers mod $n$, though the term 'division' is rarely used. It's more common to use 'multiplicative inverses'. That is, if $a$ is an element of some ring $R$, it's multiplicative inverse (if it exists) is an element $b$ such that $a \cdot b = 1$, where $1$ is the unity of $R$. The multiplicative inverse of element $a$ is commonly notated as $a^{-1}$.

In the case of integers mod 10, the multiplicative inverse of 3 would be 7 as 3 * 7 = 21 = 1 under mod 10. An analog to division would look something like:
  $ 5/3 = 5 \cdot 3^{-1} = 5 \cdot 7 = 35 = 5.$

For very large moduli, Bezout's Identity with the extended Euclidean algorithm are often used to find multiplicative inverses (see RSA key generation).
